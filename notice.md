To RAIN players:
     Found a surprise! After the technical community updated the RAIN security system, the smart contract has been fully restored. The system will resume operation on June 4, 2020. Due to the time required for block synchronization, the data is completely synchronized in about 48 hours! The RAIN ecological community will, as always, never give up, let us witness the prosperity of the RAIN world together. Stay tuned, your support is our unlimited driving force!

To RAIN players:
Unfortunately, during the update of the offer period, on the night of 2020.05.31, the RAIN contract address was hacked and stolen 892.9 ETH. We therefore apologize for the loss to the RAIN players.
In view of this incident, we will comprehensively detect the security of the network system and continue to provide services for the RAIN ecological consensus, and the RAIN ecological consensus is determined to never waver.
Regarding the player's loss, we will use 3% of the technical fee as compensation, and the specific compensation method will be released in the open source community.
The RAIN system will be restored soon!
Thanks to the understanding and support of RAIN players, any blow will make us more powerful!
